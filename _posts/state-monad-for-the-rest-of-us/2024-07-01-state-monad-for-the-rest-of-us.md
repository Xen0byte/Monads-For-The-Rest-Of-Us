# Table of chapters
If you are completely new to Monads, you might benefit from the gentle
introduction of [Monads for the Rest of Us][monads-for-the-rest-of-us], which uses C#.

This series uses F# and is only slightly more challenging.
Nonetheless, no previous knowledge of F# is needed, neither is
understanding of monads really necessary. In fact, the series will
start from the scratch and will build an intuition on State Monad from
the very ground up.

Enjoy the journey!


* [Chapter 1](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-1): in which you play with recursive types and recursive functions
* [Chapter 2](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-2): in which you invent Functors
