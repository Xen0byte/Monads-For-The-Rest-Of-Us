Distilling the State Monad from the very ground up. In F#, no prior knowledge needed.
<!--more-->

If you are completely new to Monads, the ticket to get you in the loop
could be the gentle introduction of [Monads for the Rest of
Us][monads-for-the-rest-of-us] which uses C# examples. This series,
instead, uses F# and is only slightly more challenging.  
Nonetheless, no previous knowledge of F# is needed, neither is
understanding of monads. In fact, the series starts from the scratch
and builds an intuition on State Monad from the very ground up.

## Table of chapters
* [Chapter 1](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-1): in which you play
  with recursive types and recursive functions.
* [Chapter 2](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-2): in which you find
  that binary trees have no more secrets for you.
* [Chapter 3](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-3): in which you invent
  Functors.
* [Chapter 4](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-4): in which you hit a
  brick wall.
* [Chapter 5](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-5): in which you face an
  existential crossroad.
* [Chapter 6](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-6): in which you discover
  that Procrastination&reg; is The Functional Solution to all problems.

Enjoy the journey!
