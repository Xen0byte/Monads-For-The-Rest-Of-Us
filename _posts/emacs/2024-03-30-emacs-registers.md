In our exploration of the ways to navigate back to previous buffer
positions, Registers can be seen as mark ring items with an assigned
name, so that they can be accessed by that name in an arbitrary order.  
But in fact they are much, much more:

- They can be persisted so they survive reboots.
- They can resurrect killed buffers.
- Other than buffer positions, they can contain snippets of code,
  keyboard macros, windows layouts and even custom values.


Playing Hansel and Gretel is just the excuse to happily slip into
yet another rabbit hole.  
Let's go!  <!--more-->
# Table of Contents
* [Mark Ring](/emacs-mark-ring)
* Registers
* Bookmarks

As we saw in [the previous installment](/emacs-mark-ring), rings are a
beautiful and powerful idea. Being cyclic LIFO data structures they
are very suitable for traversing back histories. For example:

* The history of changes in the case of `undo-ring`.
* The history of cursor positions for the `mark-ring`.


There are instances, though, where you might prefer to mark a position
in a more definitive manner, assigning it a name, akin to pinpointing
a location on a map and labelling it as "Home" or "Best pub in
town". 

In this case, there are better data structures than a ring. As
a programmer, you might prefer a key-value lookup table. 

## By hand, from the scratch
Imagining to use single characters as keys, storing the current
position in the current buffer and associating it to the key `a` could
be easily done with a hash table with something like:

```emacs-lisp
(setq buffer-positions (make-hash-table))

(puthash 
  'a 
  '((current-buffer) . (point)) 
  buffer-positions)
```

The first command defines `buffer-positions` as a hash-table
variable.  
Then we use `(puthash KEY VALUE TABLE)` to store the cons cell
`'(CURRENT-BUFFER . CURRENT-POSITION)` at the key `a`.

Applying what we learnt in [Emacs: Let's surround! - Prompt the user
for input](/emacs-surround-2), we could conceive a function

- to ask the user for the key.
- to read the value back from `buffer-positions` with `gethash`.
- to finally jump back to the right buffer (with `switch-to-buffer`)
  at the right position (with `goto-char`).

```emacs-lisp
(defun jump-back-to (key)
  (interactive "cPosition key: ")
  (let* ((value (gethash key buffer-positions))
         (buffer (car value))
         (position (cdr value)))
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)
    (goto-char position)))
```

Congrats! You just invented the notion of registers!

## Humble Association Lists
As lookup tables, [Hash Tables][hash-tables] are amazingly fast,
especially with large data sets. Indeed, they offer O(1) constant time
reads. But in the humble case of recording buffer positions maybe we
are killing a fly with a cannon and perhaps a simpler
[alist][association-lists] storing `'(KEY . (BUFFER . POSITION)` would
suffice:

```emacs-lisp
(setq buffer-positions '())

(push
 (cons 'a  (cons (current-buffer) (point)))
 buffer-positions)

;; equivalently, but maybe more mysteriously
(push
 `('a . (,(current-buffer) . ,(point)))
 buffer-positions)
```

The function to jump back would be the same as before, only using
`alist-get` instead of `gethash`:

```emacs-lisp
(defun jump-back-to (key)
  (interactive "cPosition key: ")
  (let* ((value (alist-get 'a buffer-positions))
         (buffer (car value))
         (position (cdr value)))
    (switch-to-buffer buffer)
    (goto-char position)))
```

Of course, this is na√Øve in so many ways:

- There is no error management. What if the user selects a key for
  which no position has been stored?
- If the buffer has been killed, it would be nice if the function
  visits it.
- Why to limit ourselves to store positions only?
- And finally, and more importantly: how could we imagine that such a
  functionality wasn't already natively implemented in Emacs?

Let's discover what Emacs has to offer out-of-the-box.

## Registers
Registers are implemented in Emacs the same way we just described them
above: a single alist variable, called `register-alist`, containing
keys and values. Plus, naturally, a large set of functions to operate
on them.

Once you have stored a couple of buffer positions, one to key `a`
(ASCII `97`) and one to `x` (ASCII `120`), the value of
`register-alist` would be something like:

```emacs-lisp
((120 . #<marker at 556 in *scratch*>)
 (97 . #<marker at 3805 in 2024-03-30-emacs-registers.md>))
```

That's exactly the same structure we played with before.

The fact that registers are stored in an ordinary variable offers the
possibility to build on top of them re-using the whole arsenal of Lisp
and Emacs tools.  
This is what never ceases to amaze me of Emacs: its building blocks
are just the simplest ideas you could think to, and the fact they are
orthogonal and composable puts no limits to what you can build with
them.  
Many other editors also offer a notion of registers; it is very
likely, though, that they are implemented as a special feature, alien
to other building blocks. Vim, for example, has a notion of variables,
yet registers are something special, accessed with peculiar `getreg`
and `setreg` functions.  
On the contrary, Emacs registers are nothing special: just items in an
ordinary association list.

What makes them so useful is the set of functions built around them.

## Functions
Akin to `set-mark-command (C-SPC)` to store a position in a mark, and
its alternative `C-u C-SPC` to pull it back &mdash; as we saw in [Mark
Ring](/emacs-mark-ring) &mdash; you might expect 2 equivalent
functions for registers also must exist. And you are right:

| Command                         | Functionality                        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `point-to-register (C-x r SPC)` | Store current location in a register |
| `jump-to-register (C-x r j)`    | Go to location stored in a register  |

I bet that you can implement yourself both, in their basic form. Do
this, please, only to appreaciate how beautifully designed Emacs is.

Registers are so useful that by default they have a whole area of key
bindings under `C-x r`, where `r` stands of course for
Register. Keybindings in Emacs are completely arbitrary and you can
always redefine them, but I think the standard ones for registers are
fairly convenient:

| Key binding | Mnemonic                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `C-x r SPC` | Akin to `C-SPC` for mark ring |
| `C-x r j`   | `r`egister `j`jump            |


I'm biased, though: I think that learning Emacs by memorizing
thousands of shortcuts is a pointless torture. Instead, as a
programmer, I would rather focus on commands and use packages such as
[which-key][which-key] to help my terrible memory.

## Oh My Consult!
Ah, yes: of course, how to forget the amazing [consult][consult]? Just
like there is a `consult-mark` for the mark ring, run
`consult-register`:

- to list all the registers.
- to filter them in real time.
- to browse them, displaying a in real-time preview.
- to hit enter and finally jump to the desired location.

## Getting files back to life
If `register-alist` were to store not just a reference to buffers,
but to their underlying file names too, then the function
`jump-to-register` would be able to navigate back to closed
files. That would come in very handy, wouldn't it? And it would not be
that hard to develop.  
But things are often a bit trickier than expected. Think to dired:
with dired one can move or rename a file and when this happens, all the
registers mentioning that filename should be updated. There is also a
`rename-file` functions, and who knows which package uses it.  
So, there should be a way to keep the file names stored in registers
up to date.

In reality, Emacs implements a different approach: registers keep only
references to buffers (`markers`) while they are alive, so they are
indipendent from file names. Right before a buffer is killed, its
`marker` registers are updated and converted to a different type,
called `file-query` and containing a file name instead of a buffer reference.

You can see this in action:

- Visit a file.
- Set any location in that file in a register: `C-x r SPC RET a`.
- Display the value of `register-alist` with `M-x describe-variable
  RET register-alist RET`.
  
You will see something like:

```emacs-lisp
((97 . #<marker at 7197 in 2024-03-30-emacs-registers.md>))
```

Notice how the register `a` is labelled as `marker` and how it does not mention the file name at all.  
Now:

- Kill the buffer.
- Display the value of `register-alist` again:
  
```emacs-lisp
((97 file-query
     "/home/arialdo/prg/markdown/arialdomartini.github.io/_posts/emacs/2024-03-30-emacs-registers.md"
     7197))
```

If you ask Emacs to jump back to register `a`, it will find a register
of type `file-query` and it will then ask if you desire to visit that file again.

## Beyond positions
I can hear your inner-programmer's voice suggesting: "Hey! If
`register-alist` is an ordinary variable, if it is already used to
store `markers` and `file-queries` types, then why not to use it to
store other kinds of elements too, such as keyboard macros, snippets of text and the like?"  
And this is very legit ambition! There is indeed no reason not to do
that. In fact, there are other groups of functions for storing and
retrieving other kinds or elements with registers:

| Kind of element                   | Command                            | Key binding          | Functionality                                                                              |

I insist: don't be intimidated by shortcuts. Think to commands
instead. They are way more intuitive. `M-x` &mdash; and consult
&mdash; are your best friends. If, and only if, if happen to use `C-u
number C-x r n` so many times that you will find it convenient to
learn the key sequence, then memorize it. Otherwise, just enjoy Emacs
and forget its shortcuts.
