## TL;DR

If you are learning how to Touch Type, use this cheat sheet. Print it, and forget about the keyboard.

# It's about your fingers, not about the keyboard

I'm a late touch typer. I learned to type without looking in my 40s, after years of bad habits. Consequently, learning to touch type hasn't be the simplest task to me.

Besided the unavoidable and boring hours of exercise, the trick that helped me the most was:

> Stop thinking to *position of keys on the keyboard*
>
> Start thinking about *which finger to use*.

The above cheat sheet may help you doing this.

## A printed keyboard is a keyboard anyway

Learning how to touch type is all about learning **not to look to the keyboard**, right?<br />
Yet, most of the web sites for learning touch typing suggest to use cheat sheets like the following:

Do you see the problem?

> As long as a cheat sheet shows a keyboard, you will be thinking about the keyboard and, as a consequence, you will be tempted to look at it.

Looking at a keyboard printed on a sheet of paper is no better than looking to the physical keyboard. In both cases you will be failing at Touch Typing. Remember, the goal is to type without looking at a keyboard. Ideally, the moment you touch type, there's no keyboard at all: only a direct connection between the character you want to type and a finger movement.

The only trick I know is: stop thinking to the keyboard, make an association between characters and fingers instead.

## The Home Row is your best friend

Your fingers can feel the so called [home row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing#Home_row) by sensing the raised dot on the `F` and `J` keys. Rest your fingers there and focus on letters and fingers.

Now, with your hands in that placement, you already know the letter `J` is just under your right hand index. I mean, if you type with *that* finger, you will get a `J`, right? It's just a plain simple thing to remember: a direct association.<br />

Well, that's all you need to know  about the `J`.<br />
Think about it: do you mind *where* the `J` key is, on the keyboard? No, you don't. On the contrary, thinking about it would just move your focus to the keyboard, which you don't want, since your only single goal you have is exactly to make the keyboard disappear.<br />
So, just don't think about it. **Start thinking that your right hand index *is* the `J` letter.**

Equally, do the same for the letter `U`.<br />
For getting a `U` you have to move your left hand index up.

Stop thinking to `U` as an absolute key position on the keyboard. This won't help in any way. Instead, `U` **is** your right hand index, moved up.

I'm not saying this will get you to touch type in minutes. You will need hours of exercise anyway.<br />
But removing the keyboard from your thoughts will be of great help.<br />
Print the cheat sheet and keep it in front of you when exercising.<br />
Forget the keyboard. Happy touch typing!
