No doubt that the MediatR library is very successful and largely adopted. While there are tons of articles about it, only a minority of them focus on the drawbacks and help identify the cases when using it does not make that much sense.<br/>
This post is one of them.

# The Mediator Pattern
MediatR presents itself as a 

> simple mediator implementation in .NET*

Let's then start quickly reviewing what the Mediator Pattern is, because this already reserves some surprises.


The Mediator Pattern is one of the classical behavioral patterns introduced by the seminal book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](gof), dated back in 1994.

In its very detailed dissertation, when discussing the pattern motivation, the book makes use of a specific example: I'm going to reuse it, keeping the original names. This will hopefully make it easier to reference back to the original exposition.

## The original GOF example 

Consider the implementation of a dialog box in a graphical user interface, and assume it uses a collection of widgets such as buttons, menus, and entry fields.<br/>
Imagine the widgets have a set of dynamic and not trivial dependencies between them:

> For example, a button gets disabled when a certain entry field is empty. 
> Selecting an entry in a list of choices called a list box might change 
> the contents of an entry field. Conversely, typing text into the entry field
> might automatically select one or more corresponding entries in the list box. 
> Once text appears in the entry field, other buttons may become enabled that
> let the user do something with the text, such as changing or deleting the
> thing to which it refers.

That's the messy dependency we wish to defend ourselves from: 

![A client class using a set of interdependent widgets](static/img/mediatr/font-dialog-2.png)


## Encapsulate the complexity
I guess you already got the idea: you want your client code to use the dialog box, but in the meanwhile you want to be saved from the complex inter-dependencies between widgets.

The gist of the Mediator Patter is that

> you can avoid these problems by encapsulating collective behavior in a separate
> mediator object. A mediator is responsible for controlling and coordinating the
> interactions of a group of objects. The mediator serves as an intermediary that 
> keeps objects in the group from referring to each other explicitly. 
> [Your client code] only knows the mediator, thereby reducing the number of
> interconnections.

In the following diagram, `aFontDialogDirector` is our Mediator.

![A client class using a set of interdependent widgets, via a Mediator](static/img/mediatr/font-dialog-3.png)

In the Mediator Pattern lingo, the widgets objects we want to abstract from are called *Colleagues*: they interact with each other in whatever arbitrary way, but our Client class won't mind, as their interaction is completely encapsulated inside the *Mediator*.<br/>
The Mediator is conventionally called *Director*, as its goal is to coordinate the *Colleagues*; it is injected into our client.


## Implementing the Mediator Pattern
So, summarizing: rather than getting the references to all the widgets, and being unwillingly obligated to deal with the complexity of their behavior, your client would conveniently receive just an instance of the intermediary mediator object.<br/>
The implementation is straighforward:

![MyClient is decoupled from FontDialogDirector via the use of its interface](/static/img/mediatr/through-interface.png)


```csharp
internal interface IFontDialogMediator
{
    void ShowDialog();
}

class FontDialogDirector : IFontDialogMediator
{
    private readonly ListBox _lisBox;
    private readonly Button _button;
    private readonly EntryField _entryField;

    FontDialogDirector(ListBox lisBox, Button button, EntryField entryField)
    {
        _lisBox = lisBox;
        _button = button;
        _entryField = entryField;
    }

    void IFontDialogMediator.ShowDialog()
    {
        // interacts with the 3 widgets,
        // taking care of the complexity of their interdependencies
    }
}

class MyClient
{
    private readonly IFontDialogMediator _fontDialogDirector;

    MyClient(IFontDialogMediator fontDialogDirector)
    {
        _fontDialogDirector = fontDialogDirector;
    }

    void DoStuff()
    {
        _fontDialogDirector.ShowDialog(); // encapsulates the complexity
    }
}
```

That's it. This is plain old OOP, with a splash of dependency injection.

### Observations
Notice the following facts:

* Our Mediator object is related to the business use case we wished to encapsulate. It is domain-specific.

* No surprises, then, that its interface is named after our specific domain language.

* The same Mediator object could easily implement any other additional method our business use case needs. Each method would be conveniently named in terms of our domain language.

* The project can easily include another different Mediator implementation, covering a distinct business use case. This different mediator would of course define a different set of business-driven methods, with their specific names.

* `MyClient` can only interact with the font dialog. Should another mediator class exist, our `MyClient` would be conveniently kept decoupled from it. The received `IFontDialogMediator` mediator would not inadvertently expose `MyClient` to domain use cases that are not intended to be made available. In other words, by no means does injecting `IFontDialogMediator` make `MyClient` violate the Interface Segregation Principle.<br/>We will get back to this later.

## MediatR
How does MediatR fit in this? Well, not that much.

In the MediatR lingo, the class `FontDialogDirector` would be a *Request Handler*. MediatR requires that it implements a the specific interface `IRequestHandler<U, V>`, provided by the library. `IRequestHandler<U, V>` defines the method 

```csharp
Task<V> Handle(T request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```

As you see, this signature is not specific to your business case. Every handler using MediatR must implement the very same method, specialized via the type parameters `U` and `V`. 

Very interestingly, according to MediatR you don't inject `FontDialogDirector` into your client code. Instead, you are supposed to inject the instance of a third class, implementing `IMediator`, also provided by the library, to which you can send request objects. In turn, requests objects have to implement an other interface, `IRequest<V>`, also provided by the library.<br/>
Once sent to `IMediator`, your request objects would be finally dispatched to the Request Handler `FontDialogDirector`.

This might sound a bit confusing, and indeed it is. As a supposed implementation of the Mediator Pattern, MediatR adds some extra layers of indirection which are not part of the original design.

![A class diagram showing the extra layer implemented by MediatR](static/img/mediatr/with-mediatr.png)

Compare this with the class diagram we implemented before:

![MyClient is decoupled from FontDialogDirector via the use of its interface](/static/img/mediatr/through-interface.png)

### MediatR's motivation

One might ask why this design choice. A possible explaination is because MediatR just does not implement the Mediator Pattern, and has got a different motivation and goal.

Indeed, while the original [GOF](gof)'s motivation is:

> define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact [...] and to vary their interaction independently.

reading the [MediatR Wiki](mediatr-documentation#basics), it sounds like the MediatR library's goal is merely:

> decoupling the in-process sending of messages from handling messages


This would explain why the example used in the MediatR wiki does not encapsulate any complex object interactions at all.<br/>
Let's see that in more details.

## The basics with MediatR

Let's analyze the [MediatR Wiki](mediatr-documentation) code example:

```csharp
class Ping : IRequest<string> { }

class PingHandler : IRequestHandler<Ping, string>
{
    public Task<string> Handle(Ping request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return Task.FromResult("Pong");
    }
}

class MyClass
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;
    
    MyClass(IMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }
    
    void DoSomething()
    {
        var response = await _mediator.Send(new Ping());
        Debug.WriteLine(response); // "Pong";
    }
}
```

Here's the same represented with a class diagram:

![With MediatR](static/img/mediatr/with-mediatr.png)


### Observations
It is interesting to notice the following:

* In the Mediator Pattern lingo, `PingHandler` would be the Director, encapsulating the complexity of interactions between the *Colleagues*. Curiously, encapsulating complexity is not a topic the MediatR wiki mentions. 

* The Mediator object does not implement an interface specific to our domain. On the contrary: our domain class now is forced to implement an interface defined in a third party library, which pertains more to the plumbing infrastructure than to the business layer.

* Our Mediator object cannot implement any other additional methods. `Handle()` is the only method that is made available. No way to name the operation in terms of the domain language. As matter of fact, the typical outcome of the adoption of MediatR is the spread of `Send()` and `Handle()` invocations, no matter the domain.<br/>
Compare that to the sample class used in the [Wikipedia Mediator Pattern's page][mediator-wikipedia]:
```java
class Mediator<T> {
    public void setValue(String storageName, T value) [...]
    public Optional<T> getValue(String storageName)  [...]
    public void addObserver(String storageName, Runnable observer) [...]
    void notifyObservers(String eventName) [...]
}
```
This is a very peculiar interface, based on a specific domain case. Implementing this with MediatR is just not possible.


* Unexpectedly, `MyClass` does not receive the `PingHandler`, but an instance of `IMediator`. The consequences of this are brillantly dissected in an interesting post by Scott Hannen, [No, MediatR Didn't Run Over My Dog][over-my-dog]

* By invoking `Send()` on `IMediator`, `MyClass`' requests can be dispatched to whatever handler defined in the whole project. The Interface Segregation Principle has been violated, as `IMediator` acts as a Service Locator. More on this later. 

* There is no way to infer which relation `MyClass` has with the handlers defined in the project, but reading its implementation.<br/>
`MyClass`' constructoror lose the ability to convey this information. This is a typical consequence of the Service Locator anti-pattern, as detailed in the classical Mark Seemann's [Service Locator is an Anti-Pattern][service-locator].


## Back to plain OOP
Leaving aside that the example MediatR uses does not seem to need any Mediator Pattern, it is interesting to notice how we could obtain the very same result with a much simpler implementation.

Let's see what happens getting rid of the extra layer of indirection, here represented in red:

![With MediatR](static/img/mediatr/with-mediatr.png)

and implementing instead:

![With an interface](static/img/mediatr/without-mediatr.png)



```csharp
class Ping : IRequest<string> { }

class PingHandler : IRequestHandler<Ping, string>
{
    public Task<string> Handle(Ping request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return Task.FromResult("Pong");
    }
}

class MyClass
{
    private readonly IRequestHandler<Ping, string> _pingHandler;
    
    MyClass(IRequestHandler<Ping, string> pingHandler)
    {
        _pingHandler = pingHandler;
    }

    async Task DoSomething()
    {
        var response = await _pingHandler.Handle(new Ping());
        Debug.WriteLine(response); // "Pong";
    }
}
```

or, simplifying even further, and finally using domain names:

![With an interface](static/img/mediatr/without-mediatr-simplified.png)


```csharp
record struct Ping; // The Query object

interface IPingHandler
{
    string Ping(Ping request);
}

class PingHandler : IPingHandler // Its handler
{
    string IPingHandler.Ping(Ping request) =>
        "Pong";
}

class MyClass
{
    private readonly IPingHandler _pingHandler;

    MyClass(IPingHandler pingHandler)
    {
        _pingHandler = pingHandler;
    }

    private void DoSomething()
    {
        var response = _pingHandler.Ping(new());
        Debug.WriteLine(response); // "Pong";
    }
}
```

Notice the main difference:

* The implementation still decouples the in-process sending of messages from handling messages, which is the declared goal of MediatR.

* `MyClass`' constructor gets an instance of the *query handler*, rather than an instance of a *3rd component who knows how to reference the handler*. That's one level of indirection less. That's the KISS principle in action.

* `MyClass` does not depend on a 3rd party library.

* This simplified implementation makes it apparent that the Request class `PingRequest` is fundamentally unnecessary: it was introduced by MediatR because of the extra indirection step, as a way to infer which Handler to dispatch the call to. By using an interface, this could be further simplified.


# More details
## Glorified Service Locator
Describing the Mediator Pattern, Ward Cunningham wrote:

> When using MediatorPattern be careful to ensure that it does not become an (expensive) substitute for global variables and all the bad things that come with that AntiPattern. 
[Ward Cunningham - Mediator Pattern][ward-cunningham]

Compare the following:

```csharp
// Implicit
IMediator mediator = GetMediatorSomehow();

var myClass = new MyClass(mediator);
```

with

```csharp
// Explicit
IPingHandler ping = GetPingHandlerSomehow();

var myClass = new MyClass(ping);
```

While the the latter can only send `Ping` messages via `IPingHandler`, the former might emit `Ping` messages for `IPingHandler`, a `Foo` message for `IFooHandler` or any other message: dependencies just cannot be inferred from its interface.

This is the very same issue of injecting a Service Locator.

This should not come as a surprise: despite being largely considered an anti-pattern (see [Mark Seemann - Service Locator is an Anti-Pattern][service-locator]), the MediatR author believes it's not and sees no problems using it in these circumstances.

## It violates the Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle states that

> Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that
> they do not use


As Scott Hannen notes:

> Code that depends on MediatR is similar. We must look at every use of mediator and see what commands or queries are sent to it. There could be dozens of command and query handlers registered with MediatR. What restricts a class from sending a different command or query, something unrelated to the purpose of that class? Nothing. Those new dependencies are hidden, obscured behind the IMediator. MediatR opens the door to the same code smells as a service locator if we use it as a service locator.


## Browsing code
There are 2 other unfortunate drawbacks when using MediatR.<br/>
The first is that browsing code is just less convenient.

With our hand-made Mediator, navigating from the `Ping` invocation gets you to its definition in `IPingHandler` or its implementation:

```csharp
    private void DoSomething()
    {
        var response = _pingHandler.Ping(new());
        Debug.WriteLine(response); // "Pong";
    }
```

This does not work with MediatR: navigating from `Send()`

![screenshot of a client using MediatR](static/img/mediatr/screen-1.png)

will get you to an externally defined method: 

![definition of Send](static/img/mediatr/screen-2.png)

One option you have is to navigate from `PingRequest` to its implementation; from there you can find its usages, and finally identify the handler. This is of course way less convenient than a single shortcut.

The reason why this happens is again because the relationship between the client code and the mediator object (the Hadler) is through the extra layer of indirection we already saw before:

![A class diagram showing the extra layer implemented by MediatR](static/img/mediatr/with-mediatr.png)

## Handlers are bound at runtime
The extra layer of indirection is the cause of another, possibly more subtle, drawback.

As a matter of fact the compiler has no way to support you making sure that a Request class is properly handled: whether a `PingRequest` is handled by 0, 1 or more Request Handlers can only be checked at runtime. You will probably need to compensate this problem with the addition of some extra unit tests, because you won't receive any compilation error.


## Unused classes
The extra layer of indirection is also the reason why your Handler classes  would be detected by the compiler as unused. This is a well known and annying issue.

![Unused classes](static/img/mediatr/unused-classes.png)

The classic workaround is to annotate all the handlers with the `[UsedImplicitly]` annotation, provided by the NuGet package [JetBrains.Annotations][jetbrains-annotations]. There are other worarounds you might use, which are described in Phil Scott's [UsedImplicitly on External Libraries][used-implicitly]).

Let me stress again that this is specific to MediatR, not to the application of the Mediator Pattern: as a matter of fact, our simple hand-made Mediator Pattern implementation does not suffer from any of the issues above.

Curiously, another popular package affected by the very same problem is Automapper, also by the same author.




# Conclusion
MediatR is not an implementation of the Mediator Pattern: it is instead an in-process bus, largely based on the Service Locator pattern. Its use creates a coupling between your business code and interfaces externally defined, and in most of the cases a hardly justified extra layer of indirection.

Chances are you can successfully replace it with a plain interface.
