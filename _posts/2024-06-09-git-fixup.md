We all know how to use `git commit --amend` to fix up the very last commit.  
How beautiful would it be to have a command like:

```
git commit --amend=3
```

to extend this power to fix up the 3rd to last &mdash; or any other past &mdash; commit?

Enter git fixup.
<!--more-->
# TL;DR
Add this alias to your `.gitconfig`:

```
[alias]
	fixup = "!f() { TARGET=$(git rev-parse $1); git commit --fixup=$TARGET ${@:2} && GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autostash --autosquash $TARGET^; }; f"
```

The use it as follows:

- Make a change.
- Stage with `git add .`
- Fix up the desider commit (`git fixup <SHA-1>`).
- (Shell completion should work. Woah!)
- Profit.

## How it works
### Rebase
Some devs are scared byt the very notion of rebasing, but in fact a
rebase is an embarassingly simple thing: just a series of cherry-picks.

With a tree such as:

```
* 84831ab  (HEAD -> branch) branch 3
* 65b297f  branch 2
* 66fe73c  branch 1
| * 7208745  (master) five
| * 6f3ab93  four
|/
* 85f4b7e  three
* 7011e1f  two
* 76ec393  one
```

rebasing `branch` on top of `master` with:

```bash
git rebase master
```

is just equivalent to:

```bash
git reset --hard master

git cherry-pick 66fe73c  # 1st commit
git cherry-pick 65b297f  # 2nd commit
git cherry-pick 84831ab  # 3rd commit
```

### Interactive rebase
Adding the `--interactive` flag to `git rebase` allows you to fine
tune the series of cherry-picks before their execution.

If instead of the previous:

```bash
git rebase master
```

you run:

```bash
git rebase master --interactive
```

your preferred editor will pop us, with this content:

```
pick 66fe73c 1st commit
pick 65b297f 2nd commit
pick 84831ab 3rd commit
```

This gives you the chance to do all sorts of magic before rebasing,
such as re-arranging the cherry-picks in a different order, squashing
two of them together, splitting commits, modifying their messages and
the like.

In other words, `--interactive` creates a transient todo-list file, a
little script of commands for Git to execute.

This is the first key to understanding how `git fixup` works.

### Commit message based commands
The second key revolves around a little known option of the `git
rebase` command: `--autosquash`.

As a matter of fact, not only can the user edit the todo-list file,
but Git also *interprets* the commit messages in search of commands.  
This is similar to the functionality often use with GitHub to close an
issue by mentioning it with a special syntax such as `#fixes` in a
commit message.

Indeed, during an [interactive rebase][rebase]:

> If a commit message starts with "squash! ", "fixup! " or "amend! ",
> the remainder of the subject line is taken as a commit specifier,
> which matches a previous commit if it matches the subject line or
> the hash of that commit.


In order to instruct Git to interpret those commands, you shall use the
`--autosquash` option.

So, the trick for fixing up the 3rd to last commit is to add a new
commit with a properly forged message mentioning the 3rd to last
commit's message:

```
pick 3732234 fixup! 3rd commit
pick 66fe73c 1st commit
pick 65b297f 2nd commit
pick 84831ab 3rd commit
```

and then running an interactive rebase.

### Letting Git forge the proper commit message
Let's fine tune the idea. As a matter of facts, you don't even have to
type that message. Just type:

```bash
git commit --fixup 84831ab
```

and Git will diligently copy the 3rd to last commit message.


### Executing the rebase
Now it's a matter of executing the interactive rebase, with this magic
`--autosquash` option.  
The only outstanding problem is that for this fixup to work, the
rebase must be interactive, but you don't really want to be asked for
any input. You prefer having a `git fixup` command does completes all
the necessary tasks without interrupting you.

The trick is to use `true` as the interactive editor.  
`true` is a little tiny program that does nothing, successfully (it
takes [80 lines][true.c] to do so).


This should give you all the ingredients to interpret the alias.  
If you are one of those horrible developers who refuse to copy-paste a
snippet of code before they really understand it, here's a breakdown.

## Interpreting the alias
The alias is indeed kind of a mouthful. Let's break it down.

| Part                          | Meaning                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `!f() { ... }; f`             | Define a shell function named `f`; at the end, execute it.                                                                                                     |
| `TARGET=$(git rev-parse $1);` | Get the full commit hash of the target commit, specified in the first Bash argument (`$1`).                                                                    |
| `git commit --fixup=$TARGET`  | Create a new commit setting the commit message to `fixup! <commit message of the target commit>`.                                                              |
| `${@:2}`                      | Optionally, allows you to pass additional arguments to commit.<br/>`${@:2}` in Bash refers to all the command line arguments starting from the second one.     |
| `&&`                          | This is a shell operator that executes the next command only if the previous one succeeded.                                                                    |
| `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true`    | Tell Git to use `true` as the dummy editor for the interactive rebase.<br/>`true` always succeedes, actually turning the interactive rebase as non-interactive |
| `git rebase `                 | Start the rebase...                                                                                                                                            |
| `           -i`               | interactively...                                                                                                                                               |
| `           --autostash`      | stashing any uncommitted changes before rebasing...                                                                                                            |
| `           --autosquash`     | squashing the fixup commit into the target commit...                                                                                                           |
| `           $TARGET^;`        | from the commit before (`^`) the target commit (`$TARGET`).                                                                                                    |


# It's Magit!
[Magit][magit], the amazing Git client running on top of
[Emacs][emacs], offers a very convenient way to select the past commit
to modify.

The feeling is just like having editable commits.  
And indeed Magit offers a command called `magit-rebase-edit-commit`
that lets you freely edit the content of any commit.

Yes, Magit is magic. But, of course, under the hood, there's nothing
but a simple, fixup rebase.

Enjoy rewriting history!
