Virtually all the tutorials on Monads introduce them only after a lengthy discussion about Functors, and often resorting to intrepid and debatable metaphors.  
I dare to take a different path and to go straight to the point, following what Mike Vanier did in his seminal 8-post series [Yet Another Monad Tutorial][yet-another-tutorial].

I challenged myself to write a post that:

- prioritizes code over storytelling
- uses no metaphors (no boxes, no burritos)
- does not require Category Theory
- jumps past some of the trivial introductory topics, such as defining what a pure function is
- does not follow the classical Functors -> Monads narrative
- is tailored for C# developers and digestible by Java ones

# Table of chapters

* [Chapter 1](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-1): in which you realize that Monads are not things
* [Chapter 2](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-2): in which you sense that it's all about function composition
* [Chapter 3](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-3): in which you reimplement &mdash; and finally understand! &mdash; C#'s function application
* [Chapter 4](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-4): in which you liberate C# from IO side effects
* [Chapter 5](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-5): in which you make C# nondeterministic
* [Chapter 6](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-6): in which you kill null
* [Chapter 7](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-7): in which you discover that Bind is a combinator and you feel illuminated
* [Chapter 8](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-8): in which you achieve true enlightenment seeing that Functors are not boxes
* [Chapter 9](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-9): In which you see how easy functors are, and you find inner peace
