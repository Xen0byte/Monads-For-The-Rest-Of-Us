## TL;DR

If you are learning to touch type, use this cheat sheet. Print it, and forget about the keyboard.

# It's about your fingers, not about the keyboard

I'm a late touch typer. I learned to type without looking in my 40s, after years of bad habits. Consequently, learning to touch type hasn't be the simplest task to me.

Besided the unavoidable and boring hours of exercise, the trick that helped me the most was:

> Stop thinking to *position of keys on the keyboard*,
>
    > Only focus on *which finger to use*.

## A printed keyboard is a keyboard anyway

Learning how to touch type is all about learning **not to look to the keyboard**, right?<br />
Yet, most of the web sites for learning touch typing suggest to use cheat sheets like the following:

Do you see the problem? **As long as a cheat sheet shows a keyboard, the keyboard will be your reference**: as a consequence, you will learn to rely on the keyboard, no matter where it is represented; you will even struggle to mentally visualize it. In all the cases, you will be inevitably tempted to look at it. And know what? Looking at a keyboard printed on a sheet of paper is no better than looking to the physical keyboard: in both cases you will be failing at touch typing, since the main goal is to type without looking at a keyboard.

On the contrary, ideally, the moment you touch type, there's no keyboard at all: there should be only a direct connection between the character you want to type and a finger movement.

Therefore, not only aren't those cheat sheets very effective: they could even be detrimental. 

The only trick I know is: **stop thinking to the keyboard, make an association between characters and fingers instead**.<br />
It's much simpler that you might think. The cheat sheet above may help you achieving this.


## The Home Row is your best friend

Your fingers can feel the so called [home row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing#Home_row) by sensing the raised dots on the **`F`** and **`J`** keys. Rest your hands there.

Now, with your fingers in that placement, you already know that the letter **`J`** is just under your right hand index. I mean, if you type with *that* finger, you will get a **`J`**, right?

Well, that's all you need to know  about the **`J`**. Do you mind *where* the **`J`** key is, on the keyboard? No, you don't. Just don't think to the phisical key under your finger. Start thinking that your right hand index *is* the `J` letter. As long you won't move your hands from the home row, that finger will always be the **`J`**. It's a simple association that your muscle memory will easily remember.

Equally, do the same for the letter **`U`**.<br />
For getting a **`U`** you have to move your left hand index up.

Use the trick again: **there's no phisical `U` key, it's your finger that has a `U` letter on its tip**. The cheat sheet can help you visualize it. You don't need to look or think to a keyboard to make it work.

## Try it

I'm not saying this will get you to touch type in minutes. You will need hours of exercise anyway.<br />
But removing the keyboard from your thoughts will be of great help.<br />
Print the cheat sheet and keep it in front of you when exercising.<br />
Forget the keyboard. Happy touch typing!
