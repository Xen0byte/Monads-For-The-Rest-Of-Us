How an innocuous Kata shows that either emergent design does not
exist, or that a better way of doing TDD is possible.

<!--more-->
## Sirens

Test-Driven Development comes with 2 very seductive and ambitious
promises:

- **Development is really *driven* by tests**  
Not only do tests verify correctness; they also help determine what
code to write, in what order and how to structure it. In other words,
TDD helps shaping the software and determining its development
process.

- **There is an *Emergent Design***  
The system's architecture and design incrementally take shape, rather
than being fully planned upfront.

It's the alluring melody of a siren singing "Just write the tests and
abandon yourself to them: correctness and design will naturally
follow, incrementally".

## Reality
Of course, this is too good to be exactly true. As Kent Beck writes in
[TDD isn't design][tdd-isnt-design]:

> nobody with any sense says TDD replaces the need for design

In fact, *Emergent Design*, in this context, has more the meaning
discussed in the C2 Wiki article [Can An Architecture
Emerge][cs-architecture-emerge]:

The question, then, is: can TDD lead an implementation without
requiring a design upfront?

Enter the Print Diamond Kata.

## Print Diamond Kata

The Print Diamond Kata (presented by Seb Rose in [Recycling tests in
TDD][seb-rose]) is a very interesting exercise in that, if you
approach it with TDD by-the-book, it's likely that you will struggle
to be *guided* by tests and to experience an emerging design. Instead,
you will be required to do some design upfront and to conceive a
solution from a light-bulb moment.  
Tests will help *challenging* your solution, not *conceiving* it. In a
sense, the Print Diamond Kata demonstrates that Emergent Design is not
always possible.

The problem is very simple: given a letter, you are supposed to return
a string with a diamond starting with `A` with the supplied letter at
the widest point.  
For example: `printDiamond('C')` returns:

```
  A
 B B
C   C
 B B
  A
```

The conventional way to approach it in TDD is to first get the `A`
case working &mdash; hardcoding the implementation &mdash; then to
follow with `B` and then with `C` etc.

As Alistair Cockburn commented in [Thinking before
programming][alistair-cockburn]:

To me, this sounds like [Clem Fandango's "How To Draw A Owl"][owl] meme:

<img src="static/img/diamond/how-to-draw-an-owl.png" width="100%"/>

Other developers way more experienced than me (see [Review of other
devs' approaches](diamond-review)) have observed more or less the
same.

This begs the question:

> **Is it possible to apply TDD in a way that
> tests really *drive* the implementation?**

## We suck at TDD

I argue that the answer is a resounding "YES!".  
And that the reason why many have experienced the opposite is because
of the way we classically apply TDD has some fundamental fallacies.

Once we revisit a bunch of the canonical assumptions we never dared to
question, it is indeed possible to have emergent design.  
That's the goal of this article.

Along the way, I aim to debunk some myths:

- *100% code coverage* and *all green tests* mean *code correctness*
  and *production readiness*.
- Understading *how much testing is enough* is a matter of skills and
  experience, not a science.
- Tests in TDD are requirements expressed with code.




## Challenge
Before moving to the second part of this post, I invite you to try
yourself solving the Print Diamond Kata.

Notice: the goal is not just to *solve it*. The goal is *to challenge
that design can be driven by tests*. Therefore, I stress you to add
the following constraint:

> **1.  Tests should neither depend on nor impose an implementation.**

In other words, make sure not to take design decisions while writing
tests.

This resonates with the above-mentioned [TDD isn't
design][tdd-isnt-design], that makes sense to quote more extensively:

> Nobody with any sense says TDD replaces the need for design. The key
> question is *when*.
> 
> TDD offers:
> 
> - Immediate feedback for interface design decisions. You still have
>   to make those decisions. [..]
> 
> - Separation between interface design decisions & implementation
>   design decisions.


It also makes sense to have a second constraint:

> **2. Each test gets to a deliverable result providing a business
>      value increment**

Make your game. While coding, pay attention if either 

- you can build on previous implentations
- or if you find youself in a *How to Draw an Owl* situation.

When you are happy with your findings, let's meet on the second part
of this post.

(Stay tuned...)
